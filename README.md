# LED Chaser

On my I/O Board, L7 is the leftmost LED whereas L0 is the rightmost LED.

I am using the ATmega324A microchip.

All patterns can be inverted by XORing the led value assigned to port A.

What if we read user input to select the behaviour of our chaser? What if we can use a switch to choose the direction, or use buttons to manipulate the speed?
